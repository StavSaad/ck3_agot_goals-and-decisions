 gad_title_creation_decisions.0001.desc: "Standing on your flagship, you survey the vast Sea of Dorne. For generations, your family has ruled these waters, but today marks a new era. You have united the disparate clans under your banner, their loyalty secured through plunder and conquest.\n\nWith a raised sword, you declare the forging of a new dominion - a lordship encompassing the entirety of the Sea of Dorne. A wave of pride washes over you. No longer will these proud people be known as squabbling pirates or petty lords. They are united under your banner, their strength a match for any who dare challenge them. The Lordship of the Sea of Dorne is born, its future as vast and limitless as the ocean itself."

 gad_title_creation_decisions.0003.desc: "With a voice that cracks with emotion, you rise from your throne and survey your assembled court. The weight of history hangs heavy in the air. \"For too long,\" you begin, your gaze tracing the weathered faces before you, \"our ancestors have battled for dominion over these unforgiving waters. Today, we cast aside the mantle of petty lords and claim our rightful birthright!\" A hush falls over the hall, thick with anticipation. \"I proclaim the foundation of the Kingdom of the Narrow Sea! Our scattered holdings are united, our winds shall become a tempest, our flames a beacon that will light the world!\" A beat of stunned silence, then the hall erupts in cheers. Goblets are raised high, heralds trumpet the news to the waiting world. The Narrow Sea is no longer a tapestry of squabbling lords; it is a kingdom, and you are its sovereign."
